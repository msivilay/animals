        <p>Marsupials are mammals of an order whose members are born incompletely developed and are typically carried and suckled in a pouch on the mother's belly. Many of the world's cutest animals, in my opinion, are marsupials.&nbsp;

        These are just some of the general classifications of animals that I love. Thank you for joining me on this journey! To enjoy related content, please check out my classmate's website <a href="https://humberto-pineda.github.io/Animals-are-Cool/">here</a>. Note: We did not get to collaborate on this project due to time constraints. We both happen to have related content on our pages.
